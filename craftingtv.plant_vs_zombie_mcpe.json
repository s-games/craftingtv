Easy mode start you off with 60 dollars while hard mode starts you off with 20 dollars. In sandbox mode you get infinite money and you can spawn any of the waves you want at any time. If you want to play easy or hard mode you should start off with getting a money maker tower and an arrow tower. As the rounds get harder you should buy more powerful towers\/powerups to defeat the zombies. Be aware that the zombies can destroy your defences when they get close so be smart when you place your towers. "
